# Remote-Desktop-Administration

![Logo](icons/logo.svg)

**Remote Desktop Administration** is a **Java-based**, cross-platform, standalone client-server application built with *
*JavaFX**. It supports distributed message passing within LAN/WLAN environments, where a central administrator acts as
the server and provides services to connected clients.

## Features

- Console Handler, File Handler, and UI Event Handler for comprehensive log recording.
- Instant dual-messaging service enabling real-time communication between the administrator and client(s).
- Remote administrative control to shut down, restart, or log off client computers.
- Remote transfer of large files or folder contents from the administrator to client machines, with SHA-256 checksum
  verification for data integrity across different file system architectures.
- Real-time desktop screen access for administrators, useful during error detection and recovery.
- Remote software installation on client systems, supporting efficient version control and updates.

## External Libraries Used

- [**Hashids**](https://github.com/jiecao-fm/hashids-java): A lightweight, open-source library that generates short,
  unique, non-sequential IDs from numbers. It is used to create UIDs for each connected client.
